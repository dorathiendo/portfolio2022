I wanted the design to look clean and simple to be unintimidating to users who were used to analog organization of these leagues.

            <h1>Film Dev App</h1>
            <p>
              In 2016, I began developing traditional photographic film in my bathroom at home. Initially, I had ruined many rolls of film, mainly because I had difficulty remembering the steps and timing required to accurately develop film. I created the Film Dev App to assist me in the process by listing the steps required for the type of film I want to develop, starting a timer at each step, and indicating when it was time for me to take action. I have designed and developed many iterations of this app, and each time I used the app to develop my film, I made notes of what worked well and didn’t. Elements were chosen for ease of use with one hand, since the app was typically used while dealing with the film and film chemicals. Use this app at <a href="https://film-dev-app.herokuapp.com/"><b>film-dev-app.herokuapp.com</b></a>.

            <p>Below are samples of previous iterations of the app. I have tried different look-and-feels for the app, multi-page versus single-page interaction, and different kinds of instructions. Through using each version of the app, I took notes of what worked well and which elements made it easy to use.</p>
